Oh man, just got out of Deva... what the heck did I just watch? It’s like they took my brain, shook it up like a soda can and just let it fizz everywhere. Sticky popcorn in my lap, can’t feel my back properly... those seats are like medieval torture equipment. And that sound! My ears are still ringing like I’m in some kinda dream. 

Man, this movie... it’s like someone took a kaleidoscope, smashed it against an ancient statue, and out poured this whole labyrinth of scenes that make you go wait, what? I kinda loved it. Or hated it? Hard to tell when your brain’s upside down.

> There was that moment, remember, with the shadows meshing into colors? Like... a disturbed rainbow or a fever dream. I swear, I felt like I could taste the hues, man. You know those scenes where the characters didn’t talk, just... stared? Those silences were louder than a Friday night at a carnival. Felt like my heart was in a slow drum circle with ghosts.

And that character, Deva or whatever, was like watching a cosmic cat try and fail to catch laser dots. You feel for him, root for him, but also kind of want to shout “just stop, dude!” Ever get that feeling when you see someone perpetually trying to make a paper plane fly loop-de-loops? Same vibe.

Did you ask if you can download the movie? I wouldn’t recommend it. Half the magic (or madness) is being in a dark room with a sticky floor. It's like... if you watched on your laptop, you’d miss the part where your spine slowly becomes a question mark.

Spilled my drink too, I think during the part where the music got so intense you’d swear the theater was gonna launch into orbit. I could literally feel the guy behind me holding his breath or choking on a piece of popcorn. Can’t remember which.

Ah, what was the deal with those bizarre symbols? Showed up like plot confetti, I swear. Tried to read them like they might tell me the secret of life, but nah... more like a cheese grater to the brain.

Someone asked how you could watch the movie? Trust me, just let it find you. Like an anxious pigeon at a picnic. Or maybe do watch it? Up to you, just — buckle in, is all I’m saying.
